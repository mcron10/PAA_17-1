## Project Description
This repository contains a detailed analysis of a bank dataset, with insights extracted and presented in the accompanying Jupyter Notebook. The goal of the analysis is to uncover trends, customer behavior, and key performance indicators that are useful for decision-making.

## Summary of Findings
- **Customer Segmentation**:
    - Identified key customer segments based on their banking activities.
    - Segmentation helped understand which customer groups are more likely to use certain bank products (like loans, credit cards).
- **Product Performance**:
    - Certain products showed higher adoption among specific age groups and income categories.
    - Credit card adoption is closely tied with income levels and loan approvals.
- **Predictive Model Performance**:
    - Used multiple machine learning models to predict customer behavior, including logistic regression and decision trees.
    - Achieved high accuracy in predicting loan approvals and customer churn.
- **Feature Importance**:
    - Key features influencing bank decisions were identified, such as income, account balance, and previous defaults.
    - Age and employment status also play significant roles in customer behavior.
- **Customer Retention Insights**:
    - Recommendations were made to target specific customer groups with retention strategies to reduce churn.
    - Potential strategies for offering personalized products to high-value customers were outlined.
